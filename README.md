## Matrix Bismuth Screensaver

A free and open-source app to display a Matrix raining code on the screen when your device is docked or connected to a charger (a.k.a. daydream).

Available from Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.donuts.matrixbismuthscreensaver

Source: https://github.com/DoNutsLise/MatrixBismuthScreensaver

The raining code is highly customisable:
* You can change size, colour, density and speed of the characters in the raining code
* You can choose any image saved on your phone for the background of the raining code
* You can define your own "secret message", the words from which will randomly appear in the raining code. They can also be highlighted with a different colour (optionally)

To enable the screensaver navigate to Settings -> Display -> Screensaver / Daydream and choose "Matrix Bismuth Screensaver".
The Matrix rain will start when you connect your phone to  a charger (or dock it) and the screen times out.

## HOW TO INSTALL:

Option 1 (easy way) - install from Google Play. This option is recommended because it's easy to get updates.

Option 2 (harder way) - install a compiled apk from "releases" page with adb or sideload:
Here is a link with instructions: https://www.droidviews.com/install-apk-files-using-adb-commands/. Difficulty of installation is about the same as from Google Play, but you have to update manually every time.

Option 3 (hardest way) - build from source:
Here are good instructions on how to build an android apk from source using Android Studio (https://github.com/openaps/AndroidAPSdocs/blob/master/docs/EN/Installing-AndroidAPS/Building-APK.md). This type of installation is recommended for experienced users only.
