## Matrix Bismuth Screensaver

A free and open-source app to display a Matrix raining code on the screen when your device is docked or connected to a charger (a.k.a. daydream).

Source: https://github.com/DoNutsLise/MatrixBismuthScreensaver

There is a secret message (dedicated to the Bismuth blockchain) hidden in the code  - be "The One" and decode the message!

To enable the screensaver navigate to Settings -> Display -> Screensaver / Daydream and choose "Matrix Bismuth Screensaver".
The Matrix rain will start when you connect your phone to  a chareger (or dock it) and the screen times out.


## HOW TO INSTALL:

Option 1 (easy way) - install from Google Play. I would choose this option because it's easy to get updates.

Option 2 (harder way) - install a compiled apk from "releases" page with adb or sideload:
Here is a link with instructions: https://www.droidviews.com/install-apk-files-using-adb-commands/. Difficulty of installation is about the same as from Google Play, but you have to update manually every time.

Option 3 (hardest way) - build from source:
Here are good instructions on how to build an android apk from source using Android Studio (https://github.com/openaps/AndroidAPSdocs/blob/master/docs/EN/Installing-AndroidAPS/Building-APK.md). This type of installation is recommended for experienced users only.
